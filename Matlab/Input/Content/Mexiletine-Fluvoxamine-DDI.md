The mexiletine-fluvoxamine interaction was evaluated using clinical DDI studies listed in [Table 7](#table-7).

A dynamical DDI simulation with fluvoxamine as CYP1A2 inhibitor and mexiletine as victim was conducted and compared to literature data ([Kusumoto 2001](#5-references)). A typical Japanese subject (age = 30 y, weight = 61.87 kg, height = 168.99 cm, BMI = 21.67 kg/m2) was created in PK-Sim from predefined database "Japanese (2015)" by adding CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 expressions from PK-Sim RT PCR database.

A randomized crossover design with two phases was used. Each subject received an oral dose of mexiletine (200 mg) or fluvoxamine (50 mg twice a day) for 7 days, and on the eighth day they received mexiletine and fluvoxamine concomitantly.
