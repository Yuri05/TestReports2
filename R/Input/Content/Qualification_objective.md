This qualification report evaluates the developed PBPK drug-drug interactions (DDI) models network for the ability to perform simulations with the intended purpose to predict cytochrome P450 1A2 (**CYPA12**)-mediated DDI.

To demonstrate the level of confidence, the predictive performance of the platform for this intended purpose is assessed via a network of PBPK models of selected index CYP1A2 DDI perpetrators, and respective sensitive CYP1A2 victim drugs and a comprehensive dataset from published clinical DDI studies. All PBPK models represent whole-body PBPK models, which allow dynamic DDI simulations in organs expressing CYP1A2.

The respective *qualification plan* to produce this *qualification report* is transparently documented and provided open-source (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-Qualification-Reports). The same applies for all presented PBPK models including *evaluation reports* on model building and evaluation of each model (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-PBPK-Model-Library).

*Evaluation reports* including descriptions on model building and detailed evaluations of the included models are documented separately (see [Section 1.2](#12-cyp1a2-ddi-network)).

Please refer to the [Appendix](#6-appendix) to learn more details:

- An overview over the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite is given in chapter [Section 6.1](#61-open-systems-pharmacology-suite-osps-introduction)

- [Section 6.2](#62-mathematical-implementation-of-drug-drug-interactions) shows the implementation of the underlying mathematical equations for drug-drug interactions in the OSP suite.

- A detailed general description of the performed qualification workflow (*qualification plan*, *qualification report*, etc.) can be found in chapter [Section 6.3](#63-automatic-re-qualification-workflow).
