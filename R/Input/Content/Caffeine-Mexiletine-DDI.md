The caffeine-mexiletine interaction was evaluated using clinical DDI studies listed in [Table 6](#table-6).

| **Source**                   | **Route** | **Dose [mg] /** **Schedule \***   | **Pop.** | **N** |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- | -------- | ----- |
| [Joeres 1987](#5-references) | p.o.      | 366 caffeine,<br />200 mexiletine | HV       | 6     |

**Table 6:**<a name="table-6"></a> Literature sources of clinical concentration data of caffeine used for DDI prediction qualification with mexiletine.

A dynamical DDI simulation with mexiletine as CYP1A2 inhibitor and caffeine as victim was conducted and compared to literature data.

Clinical observations of caffeine-mexiletine interaction were derived from [Joeres 1987](#5-references) where 6 healthy volunteers received 366 mg caffeine (400 mg caffeine monohydrate) after an overnight fast, together with 200 mg mexiletine orally. One week later caffeine was administered alone. 

The in-built caffeine template model included in PK-Sim was used for caffeine predictions.

Competitive inhibition was assumed on CYP1A2 enzyme between caffeine (substrate) and mexiletine (inhibitor) with an inhibitory constant of 0.28 ÂµM. No reported values were found for mexiletine Ki on CYP1A2 and caffeine as substrate, so the inhibitory constant for methoxyresofurin ([Ko 1997](#5-references)) was used [calculated in vivo, unbound Ki for methoxyresofurin].
