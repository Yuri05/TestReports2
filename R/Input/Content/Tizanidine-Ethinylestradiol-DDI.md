The tizanidine-ethinylestradiol interaction was evaluated using clinical DDI studies listed in [Table 2](#table-2).

**Table 2:**<a name="table-2"></a> Literature sources of clinical concentration data of tizanidine used for DDI prediction qualification with ethinylestradiol. *EE: ethinylestradiol*

A dynamical DDI simulation with ethinylestradiol as moderate CYP1A2 inhibitor and tizanidine as victim drug was conducted and compared to literature data. Clinical observations were derived from [Granfors 2005](#5-references) in which 15 healthy women using Oral contraceptives (OCs) (ethinylestradiol + gestodene) and 15 healthy women without OCs (control subjects) ingested a single dose of 4 mg tizanidine.
