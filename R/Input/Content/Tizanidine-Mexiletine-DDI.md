The tizanidine-mexiletine interaction was evaluated using clinical DDI studies listed in [Table 5](#table-5).

**Table 5:**<a name="table-5"></a> Literature sources of clinical concentration data of tizanidine used for DDI prediction qualification with mexiletine.

A dynamical DDI simulation with mexiletine as CYP1A2 inhibitor and tizanidine as victim was conducted and compared to literature data from [Momo 2010](#5-references). The same Ki as for the caffeine interaction simulation was used (0.28 µM). The predefined “Standard European Male for DDI” individual (age = 30 y, weight = 73 kg, height = 176 cm, BMI = 23.57 kg/m2) was used.

The pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was examined in an open-label study in 12 healthy participants after a single dose of tizanidine (2 mg) with and without mexiletine co-administration (50 mg, 3 times as a pretreatment for a day and 2 times on the study day).
