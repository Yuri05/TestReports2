The predicted perpetrator/victim drug concentration-time profiles, DDI AUC and Cmax ratios confirmed that the developed PBPK models are well suited to characterize the CYP1A2 DDI network over the full range of reported DDI studies. The same Ki values could be used by the moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors EE (0.48 μM) and mexiletine (0.28 μM) with regards to all tested substrates (caffeine and tizanidine). For the strong inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine, the same Ki value (2.97 nM) could be used for both caffeine and mexiletine as substrate. In contrast, for tizanidine the Ki (0.9 nM) needed to be refitted to capture the data.

**Fluvoxamine** 

- CYP1A2 inhibition:
  - DDI simulations with caffeine, tizanidine, and mexiletine demonstrate an excellent prediction (ratio pred/obs = around 1 and within 2-fold) of the inhibitory potential of fluvoxamine on CYP1A2.

**Tizanidine**

- Substrate:

  - DDI simulations with fluvoxamine as inhibitor of tizanidine demonstrated a good prediction of tizanidine levels (pred/obs AUCR and pred/obs CmaxR within 2-fold) when using an optimized value of fluvoxamine Ki.
  - DDI simulations with mexiletine as inhibitor of tizanidine demonstrated an underprediction of tizanidine levels but were within 2-fold of observed ratios. Tizanidine is underpredicted both with and without mexiletine, probably due to an un-modelled food effect
  - DDI predictions with ethinylestradiol (EE) using a TDI mechanism was necessary to describe the      observed interaction with tizanidine. DDI simulations with ethinylestradiol demonstrated a good prediction of tizanidine levels when using TDI.

**Mexiletine**

+ Perpetrator:
  + DDI simulations with mexiletine as inhibitor of caffeine demonstrated an underprediction of caffeine levels but were within 2-fold of observed ratios.
  + DDI simulations with mexiletine as inhibitor of tizanidine demonstrated an underprediction of      tizanidine levels but were within 2-fold of observed ratios.
  + Overall, DDI predictions with mexiletine as an inhibitor tend to lead to underprediction of both AUCR and CmaxR but were within 2-fold of observed ratios.
+ Substrate:
  + DDI simulations with fluvoxamine as inhibitor of mexiletine demonstrated an excellent prediction of mexiletine levels.

**Ethinylestradiol**

- A TDI mechanism on CYP1A2 was introduced to describe tizanidine DDI study data.

- Perpetrator: 

  - DDI simulations with EE as inhibitor of caffeine demonstrated a good prediction of caffeine levels (pred/obs AUCR and pred/obs CmaxR within 2-fold).
  - DDI simulations with EE as inhibitor of tizanidine demonstrated a good prediction of tizanidine levels (pred/obs AUCR and pred/obs CmaxR within 2-fold).
