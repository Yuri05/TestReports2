The tizanidine-fluvoxamine interaction was evaluated using clinical DDI studies listed in [Table 4](#table-4).

**Table 4:**<a name="table-4"></a> Literature sources of clinical concentration data of tizanidine used for DDI prediction qualification with fluvoxamine. *\*:single dose*

In the clinical study reported by [Granfors 2004](#5-references), a single oral dose of 4 mg tizanidine was given after treatment with fluvoxamine (100mg fluvoxamine-maleate ~73.3 mg free base, q.d. for 4 days).

Initially, the Ki value for the inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine reported by [Iga 2016](#5-references) was used. While the predicted Cmax ratio matched closely the observed value, the AUC ratio was underpredicted by a factor of 2.1. Since the predictions of the tizanidine profiles without co-administration of fluvoxamine matched the observations very well, it was concluded that the most plausible reason for the under prediction was the value of Ki, as the fraction metabolized via CYP1A2 was already 99%. Hence Ki was optimized using the data from [Granfors 2004](#5-references). A Ki value of 0.8697 +/- 0.1935 nmol/L was estimated, which is still in line with the Ki values derived for other CYP1A2 substrates.
